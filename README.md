Introduction
The Walisa React Coffee Shop is a simple web application built using React. It offers the following features:

Browse and search for coffee products.
Add products to the shopping cart.
View and update the shopping cart.
Contact the shop through a contact form.

Usage
Here are some key aspects of the codebase and how to use the application:

The main application logic is in the App.js file, which defines the routes and components used in the application.

The coffee product data is stored in db.json, and the CoffeeList component fetches this data and displays it to users.

The shopping cart functionality is provided by the CartContext and components like CartProducts.

Users can leave reviews and ratings, which are managed in the SidebarContent component.

The application uses React Router for routing and navigation.

You can customize the appearance and styles of the application by modifying the CSS files in the src directory.
